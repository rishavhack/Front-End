<h2>
The CSS outline properties specify the style, color, and width of an outline.

An outline is a line that is drawn around elements (outside the borders) to make the element "stand out".

However, the outline property is different from the border property - The outline is NOT a part of an element's dimensions; the element's total width and height is not affected by the width of the outline.
</h2>
<h4>
	Outline Width
The outline-width property specifies the width of the outline.

The width can be set as a specific size (in px, pt, cm, em, etc) or by using one of the three pre-defined values: thin, medium, or thick.
