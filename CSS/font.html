<h1>
The font family of a text is set with the font-family property.

The font-family property should hold several font names as a "fallback" system. If the browser does not support the first font, it tries the next font, and so on.

Start with the font you want, and end with a generic family, to let the browser pick a similar font in the generic family, if no other fonts are available.
</h1>
<h2>
	The font-style property is mostly used to specify italic text.

This property has three values:

normal - The text is shown normally
italic - The text is shown in italics
oblique - The text is "leaning" (oblique is very similar to italic, but less supported)
<br>
The font-size value can be an absolute, or relative size.
<br>
Absolute size:
<br>
Sets the text to a specified size
<br>Does not allow a user to change the text size in all browsers (bad for accessibility reasons)
<br>Absolute size is useful when the physical size of the output is known
<br>
Relative size:
<br>
Sets the size relative to surrounding elements
<br>Allows a user to change the text size in browsers
</h2>
<h3>
	The font-weight property specifies the weight of a font:
</h3>
<h4>
	The font-variant property specifies whether or not a text should be displayed in a small-caps font.

In a small-caps font, all lowercase letters are converted to uppercase letters. However, the converted uppercase letters appears in a smaller font size than the original uppercase letters in the text.
